# House Price Prediction Project

Predicting house prices using machine learning with data cleaning, feature selection, and three regression models.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Discovery & Cleaning**
2. **Data Preparation**
3. **Model Testing**

## Models Tested

- HistGradientBoostingRegressor
- BaggingRegressor  
- DecisionTreeRegressor

## Key Features

✔ Data exploration & visualization  
✔ Missing value handling  
✔ Feature selection  
✔ Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, MdSE)  
✔ Learning curve visualization

## Data Preparation

- Label encoding for categorical features
- Log transformations
- Created binary features (HasBsmt)
- Correlation analysis

## How to Use

1. Clone repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
```

2. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

3. Run Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
```

## Results

Evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Median Absolute Error (MdSE)
